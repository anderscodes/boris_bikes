# Boris Bikes

Boris Bikes was our first weekly challenge at Maker's Academy. We were instructed to build a programme that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure of London's for rent biking system. 

This was my first experience of building a real world object orientated programme that used multiple classes that interacted in different ways. 

The project uses Test Driven Development to create a docking station that can dock and release bike objects.

It also sets a maximum capacity for the number of bikes that can be docked into the station and raises an error if you try to dock a bike over the capacity or if you try to release any bikes if the dock is empty.

I did not manage to complete all the steps outlined in the project as completion was not the aim but rather to learn as much as possible through implementation of the project.
